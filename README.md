### Project Details
This project is a commercial site for a fictional camping supply business.  Building it required making use of a wide variety of wordpress features.  As such all content can be modified through the CMS by a non-coding user/owner.

### Knowledge Gained
Practical php as it applies to wordpress.  Incorporating jquery and js scripts into a wordpress site.  Working with the CMS and building a custom plugin and theme.  The plugin was used to carry functionality that could be kept with the site should the user decide to change themes.  This includes custom taxonomies and post-types used for product and adventure categories.
